# Quality of Life modules

This addon adds a few quality of life features to the game.

Each feature (module) is disabled by default and can be turned on (and off) in the [Settings](#configuration).

## Modules

### Sticky targeting in combat

Sets Blizzard's `Sticky Targeting` while you are in combat and turns it off as soon as you leave it.

### Time to arrive for map pins

Adds a feature to map pins showing an estimated time of arrival. It will display the time it will take for you to reach your destination based on your current speed and distance to travel. This can be especially useful for long journeys, giving you a better idea of when you will arrive at your destination.

### Unlimited distance for map pins

Removes the 1000 yards limit put on map pins.

### Lower Caps

Converts CAPITALIZED text you send into chat to its lower case. It tries to combat `stuck` CAPS-LOCK. Only fully capitalized text is converted, with the exception of text that has the first letter not capitalized. In that case, it will switch the capitalization as seen in the example:

- "EXAMPLE TEXT" -> "example text"
- "eXAMPLE TEXT" -> "Example text"

## Configuration

Locate the 'QoL modules' section within the 'Options -> Addon' section.
